# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: July 24, 2025**

Thank you for using *Vocatcher*! We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information. Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we collect, use, and store information that may be involved during your use of this app.

By choosing to use our service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We do **not** actively collect or upload any personally identifiable information. All data processing is performed **locally** on your device. Unless otherwise stated in this policy, we do not use your information for any other purpose or share it with third parties.

## Data Collection Statement

To provide a better user experience, the app may request certain system permissions (such as screen recording). However, we **do not collect, upload, or store any personally identifiable information**. All data is processed **locally** on your device and is never accessed or transmitted by the developer.

## Screen Recording Permission
### Why do we request this permission?
This permission is required to enable quick extraction of selected text on the screen using a custom keyboard shortcut.

### How is the data handled?
- Only the **explicitly selected text** by the user is extracted;
- The original screenshot or screen data is discarded **immediately** after dictionary parsing is completed;
- **No screen images or videos are stored or transmitted**.

### How to manage this permission?
- The system will prompt for permission the first time screen capture is triggered;
- You can disable access at any time via  
  **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording**;
- Disabling this permission will affect the shortcut capture functionality,  
  but will not impact your ability to view or manage saved words.

## Security
We are committed to using industry-standard methods to ensure the security of local data processing. Since this app **does not involve any network transmission**, it offers stronger privacy protection compared to online services. However, please note that local data may still be exposed due to device-level security risks. We recommend safeguarding access to your device.

## Children's Privacy
This app is **not intended for children under the age of 13**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe your child is using this app and has submitted personal information, please contact us promptly so we can take appropriate action.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and will take effect immediately upon publication. We recommend reviewing this page periodically to stay informed of any updates.
